# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive cross-platform component library that works seamlessly with both React (web) and React Native applications. The library will follow modern best practices and shadcn-style architecture, providing developers with a consistent design system, flexible theming, and reusable components that maintain visual and functional parity across platforms. The library will be structured as a monorepo with shared core utilities, platform-specific implementations, and comprehensive documentation through Storybook.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a monorepo structure with organized packages, so that I can easily maintain and develop cross-platform components with shared logic and platform-specific implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL create a monorepo structure with packages for core, web, and native components
2. WHEN organizing packages THEN the system SHALL separate shared logic in core package from platform-specific implementations
3. WHEN configuring the monorepo THEN the system SHALL include demo applications for both web and React Native platforms
4. WHEN setting up package management THEN the system SHALL use workspace configuration for dependency management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a designer and developer, I want a flexible theme system with comprehensive design tokens, so that I can maintain consistent branding and easily switch between light/dark modes across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining the theme system THEN the system SHALL include color palettes with 50-900 shade variations for primary, secondary, success, error, warning, and neutral colors
2. WHEN creating design tokens THEN the system SHALL include typography scales, spacing systems, border radius tokens, shadow definitions, and gradient presets
3. WHEN implementing theme switching THEN the system SHALL support light and dark mode variations
4. WHEN accessing theme values THEN the system SHALL provide consistent API across both web and native platforms
5. WHEN customizing themes THEN the system SHALL allow easy override of default theme values

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a variant system similar to class-variance-authority, so that I can easily create component variations with consistent styling patterns across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating component variants THEN the system SHALL support base styles, variant props, compound variants, and default variants
2. WHEN defining variants THEN the system SHALL include size, color, and visual variant options for each component
3. WHEN combining variants THEN the system SHALL support compound variants for complex styling combinations
4. WHEN using variants THEN the system SHALL provide TypeScript support with proper type inference
5. WHEN applying variants THEN the system SHALL work consistently on both web and React Native platforms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a React Native developer, I want class-based styling support similar to Tailwind CSS, so that I can use familiar utility classes while working with React Native StyleSheet objects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using utility classes THEN the system SHALL support spacing classes (p-, m-, px-, py-, etc.)
2. WHEN applying colors THEN the system SHALL support background and text color classes with theme integration
3. WHEN styling layouts THEN the system SHALL support flexbox, sizing, and positioning utility classes
4. WHEN styling borders and typography THEN the system SHALL support border radius, typography, and shadow utility classes
5. WHEN resolving class conflicts THEN the system SHALL implement a cn() utility that merges classes and resolves conflicts
6. WHEN converting to native styles THEN the system SHALL transform utility classes to React Native StyleSheet objects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want five core components (Button, Card, Input, Badge, Avatar) with comprehensive variant support, so that I can build consistent UIs quickly across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Button component THEN the system SHALL support solid, outline, ghost, link, and gradient variants with multiple sizes and colors
2. WHEN implementing Card component THEN the system SHALL support elevated, outlined, filled, and gradient variants with configurable header and footer
3. WHEN implementing Input component THEN the system SHALL support outlined, filled, and underlined variants with icon support and validation states
4. WHEN implementing Badge component THEN the system SHALL support solid, outline, subtle, and gradient variants with multiple shapes and sizes
5. WHEN implementing Avatar component THEN the system SHALL support circular, rounded, and square variants with image, fallback, and status indicator support
6. WHEN using any component THEN the system SHALL provide consistent API with variant props, className/style overrides, and accessibility support
7. WHEN accessing components THEN the system SHALL support ref forwarding and proper TypeScript typing

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want platform-specific styling solutions that work together, so that I can use Tailwind CSS on web and StyleSheet on React Native while maintaining design consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling web components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS with custom theme configuration
2. WHEN styling React Native components THEN the system SHALL use StyleSheet with class-to-style mapping utilities
3. WHEN sharing styles THEN the system SHALL provide style transformers that work for both platforms
4. WHEN customizing styles THEN the system SHALL allow platform-specific overrides while maintaining consistency

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want properly configured packages with modern tooling, so that I can have an excellent development experience with TypeScript support, tree-shaking, and proper build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring packages THEN the system SHALL include TypeScript configuration with proper type exports
2. WHEN building packages THEN the system SHALL support tree-shaking with separate entry points for web and native
3. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL include ESLint, Prettier, and build scripts configuration
4. WHEN importing components THEN the system SHALL provide clean import paths and proper module resolution

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want interactive demo applications, so that I can see all components in action and understand how to implement them in my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing demos THEN the system SHALL showcase all components with all available variants
2. WHEN testing themes THEN the system SHALL include theme customization and dark mode toggle functionality
3. WHEN exploring components THEN the system SHALL provide interactive playground with live code examples
4. WHEN learning implementation THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code examples and usage patterns

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer and designer, I want comprehensive Storybook documentation for both platforms, so that I can explore components interactively and understand their capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up documentation THEN the system SHALL include Storybook for both web and React Native platforms
2. WHEN viewing stories THEN the system SHALL provide interactive controls for all component props and variants
3. WHEN exploring themes THEN the system SHALL include theme switcher and responsive viewport testing
4. WHEN accessing documentation THEN the system SHALL include MDX documentation pages with code snippets and copy functionality
5. WHEN testing accessibility THEN the system SHALL include accessibility checks and validation
6. WHEN writing stories THEN the system SHALL support unified story format that works across both platforms

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want additional utility features like composition helpers, animations, and form integration, so that I can build complete applications with enhanced user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN composing variants THEN the system SHALL provide helper utilities for variant composition
2. WHEN adding animations THEN the system SHALL include basic animation presets for both platforms
3. WHEN using icons THEN the system SHALL support integration with popular icon libraries
